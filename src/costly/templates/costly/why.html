The Raleigh GSI Cost Tool is part of the Cityâ€™s greater initiative to implement
            more Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) throughout new and existing development sites. The City has a goal to incorporate a greater number of distributed practices on site to maximize stormwater capture. The standard design that development sites use for stormwater management is designating a large portion of land adjacent to the site for the installation of an end-of-pipe conventional structure, such as a stormwater wetland or detention pond. The City wants to show developers and designers that a site can use a more creative solution that can be more cost effective compared to the conventional solutions. Using distributed practices to better manage stormwater runoff helps
            minimize the amount of excess land needed to meet the three main levels of compliance:
            <ul><li>	Nutrient management with or without buy down
                <li>	Stormwater volume requirements
                <li>	Peak flow capture
              </li>
              </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
The City is also interested in GSI because of the additional social and environmental benefits that it can provide. Several tools have been created to view the triple bottom line (i.e., economic, social, and environmental) benefits that alternative designs like GSI provide a community.
