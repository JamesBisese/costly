<strong>Directions:</strong> Review the cost tool results for your scenario. You will find life cycle cost
components on this page including, planning and design costs, construction costs, replacement costs,
operation and maintenance costs. Please note that these life cycle costs <u>do not include</u> costs for
    electrical, gas, or other utility expenses that may be inherent to the project development.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> These costs do not reflect a comprehensive assessment of life cycle cost values,
but they should be considered a guide for valuing your project scenario. Economic and policy
changes may occur over the lifetime of your project that are not accounted for in this assessment.
Performing a risk assessment and consulting with the project engineer and/or developer to compare
    these costs to real-time project costs is advised.
