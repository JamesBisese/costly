                General help text: Select from the available Conventional Structures in this Scenario for this
            Project site and insert the size of the structure. Available structures are based upon the selected
            Areal Features and Project Type as indicated by the user. Each structure has a default unit that
            cannot be changed in the tool. Non-Conventional Structures are distributed GSI systems used
            for stormwater management. The default cost items are listed under each selected structure,
            which will drive the overall life cycle costs calculated in the cost tool for each structure. Cost
            items can be added or removed from each structure in the Structure Cost Items User
                Assumptions tab.

    Lawns are vegetated landscapes made up of a grass species that provide recreational space for the Project site. They can
be implemented in many areas within the Project site. These structures need to be well-maintained to continuously
provide aesthetics to the site. While they do allow for stormwater infiltration, substituting grass lawns for other
species of vegetation can help mitigate the impacts of runoff more effectively. Shrubs are traditional vegetative
structures that add aesthetics to the Project site and can be used for screening the property. These are usually added
in many areas throughout the Project site and might be planted with lawns. The Raleigh UDO has recently been updated to
allow for greater diversity of vegetative species, particularly to mitigate stormwater using GSI, rather than
restricting the design to include only shrubs and lawn. Tree Plantings are structures that include the installation of
specimen trees that are usually new plants that will be maintained to grow into larger trees. These structures might be
included to improve the aesthetics of the landscape or ecosystem services to the community and environment like shade,
localized cooling, and habitat for species. This structure can be constructed in:

    The structure managed open space is part of Project sites that have miscellaneous landscaping and open space. This
structure is not intended to include GSI structures, but will still be managed to maintain the aesthetics of the site.
This structure would require construction and maintenance costs for items like permanent cover, sod, landscaping
planting, and specimen trees.

    Infiltration trenches can be used to provide large storage volume to hold stormwater for infiltration into the soil. The
trenches might be filled with stone or other media that can store stormwater in the voids. These traditional systems
have been used to manage upstream runoff from impervious surfaces such as parking lots, streets, and buildings.

    Stormwater wetlands can be implemented on a Project site to mitigate stormwater and help the developer meet compliance
standards. Stormwater wetlands are constructed systems that mimic the functions of natural wetlands and use physical,
chemical, and biological processes to treat stormwater. A stormwater wetland is designed to capture the design storm and
release it slowly over a period of two to five days via a properly designed outlet structure. The wetland shall be
designed in a manner that protects the device, the areas around the device and the receiving stream from erosion.
Stormwater wetlands temporarily store stormwater runoff in shallow pools that support emergent and riparian vegetation.
The storage, complex microtopography, and vegetative community in stormwater wetlands combine to form an ideal matrix
for the removal of many pollutants. Stormwater wetlands can also effectively reduce peak runoff rates and stabilize flow
to adjacent natural wetlands and streams. *narrative courtesy of NCDEQ.

    According to NCDEQ, a wet pond shall be designed to capture the design storm and release it slowly over a period of two
to five days via a properly design outlet structure. Stormwater shall have an adequate flow path to bring about removal
of TSS through dilution and settling. The pond shall be designed in a manner that protects the device, the areas around
the device and the receiving stream from erosion. The pond also must be maintained properly to prevent the resuspension
of captured sediments. The design volume for a wet pond is equivalent to the volume that is retained for a two to
five-day period between the temporary pool elevation and the permanent pool elevation.

The primary purpose of a dry pond is to attenuate and delay stormwater runoff peaks. Dry ponds hold water immediately
after a storm event and drain to be almost completely dry between storm events. Dry ponds are a secondary SCM, but can
be used in a treatment train to optimize hydraulic performance of another SCM, like a bioretention cell, for example.
They also can be used to manage peak runoff, since the overall pollutant removal efficiency of dry extended detention
basins is low. The design volume for a dry pond is the volume between the temporary pool elevation and outlet drain
elevation that will drawdown within two to five days and is determined by the volume of stormwater that is required to
be captured.

    A conventional rooftop will be included in projects that have a building structure. The conventional materials used to
build a rooftop include, but are not limited to, concrete, asphalt, shingles, metal, etc. A major cost differentiator
for conventional rooftops versus a green roof is the material costs for a traditional roof ballast versus the roof
reinforcement required for green roofs. Conventional rooftops also contribute to overall impervious surface on the
Project site. The effects of stormwater runoff on traditional rooftop structures can be mitigated with green roofs,
harvesting devices, or other downstream structures (i.e., wet or dry pond, wetland, bioretention cell, swale, filter
strip, permeable pavement).

    Asphalt pavement might be included on a site where roads, parking lots, driveways, and buildings are located. This
structure contributes to overall impervious surface in the Project site and increases the amount of stormwater runoff to
be mitigated. There are several layers that make up asphalt structures. Some of these layers can be substituted with
permeable pavement to mitigate the impacts of stormwater runoff.

    Drainage and Conveyance Systems are used to help control the flow of stormwater runoff on a Project site. These
Structures may be a part of the inlets/outlets to other Areal Features on the site, provide conveyance of stormwater
into a connected piping system, or create spatial boundaries between Areal Features on site. The City wants to encourage
less dependence on these systems for stormwater management because of their pricey replacement costs. This tool will
help developers and designers think about alternative systems that may be more cost effective to achieve the same
outcome. For some Project sites, GSI practices may be substituted, which will help minimize the amount of curb and
gutter systems on site to control stormwater.
