                General help text: Select from the available Green Infrastructures in this Scenario for this
            Project site and insert the size of the structure. Available structures are based upon the selected
            Land Cover and Project Type as indicated by the user. Each structure has a default unit that
            cannot be changed in the tool. Green Infrastructures are distributed GSI systems used
            for stormwater management. The default cost items are listed under each selected structure,
            which will drive the overall life cycle costs calculated in the cost tool for each structure. Cost
            items can be added or removed from each structure in the Structure Cost Items User
                Assumptions tab.

            If you would like to learn more information about the structure, click on the name of the
            structure. The tool will provide information about each structure including a description of what
            it is, pictures and examples of the structure being implemented, and the Land Cover that the
            structure can occur within on a Project site. The tool will also provide information about the
            additional benefits each structure provides.

            Additional 1st year maintenance costs: Tool assumes the same annual operations and
            maintenance costs across the study life of the Scenario if the user leaves the 1st year
            maintenance costs blank. User should specify additional 1st year maintenance costs (in dollars)
            for each STRUCTURE if the costs are expected to be greater during the 1st year of the project
                study life.

Swales remove pollutants from stormwater by biofiltration, settling, and infiltration. Grassed swales filter pollutants
as stormwater runoff moves through the leaves and roots of the grass. By reducing flow velocities and increasing a
site's time of concentration, grassed swales contribute to reducing runoff peaks.

    Rainwater Harvesting includes the capture of runoff from roofs, parking lots, sidewalks, and landscaped areas. These
    structures might be a cistern, rain barrel, or other storage device used on the Project site. These structures have a
    limited amount of space to capture stormwater, but can be effective with treatment and/or capture of small volumes.

    A bioretention cell is an excavated area filled with soil media, plants, grass or sod. These cells temporarily hold and
filter stormwater. Their versatility allows them to be installed in a variety of locations.

<div class="title">Filter strips</div>


    A filter strip is an area of grass or other permanent vegetation used to reduce nutrients, sediment, and other
contaminants in runoff to maintain or improve water quality. Filter strips slow the velocity of water, allowing for
water runoff to infiltrate and reducing soil loss.

    A green roof structure has low-growing plants that intercept rain water up to a specific field capacity of the medium
used for the plants to grow in. This structure has many benefits including improving air quality, saving energy, and
prolonging the life of the roof.

    Planter boxes are a type of bioretention structure that collects stormwater into a contained vegetated area. These boxes
are designed to connect to a stormwater drainage system, and can either allow stormwater to infiltrate into the ground
or have a waterproof barrier preventing stormwater from infiltrating the ground. These are small systems that can be
applied across many areas in the Project site.

    Permeable pavement captures stormwater through voids in the pavement surface and filters water through an underlying
aggregate reservoir. The reservoir typically allows the water to infiltrate into the soil subgrade. If the underlying
soil is not suitable for infiltration, the reservoir can also detain and release the water to a surface conveyance
system. This structure accommodates pedestrians, parking, and traffic while controlling the quality and quantity of
stormwater runoff.
