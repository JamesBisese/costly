<p>
General information: The tool has equations and default factors for each cost item listed under individual
structures. Cost items can be added or removed to a structure on this page. Users can reference this
page to view default assumptions and have the option to update the assumptions that make up the cost
equations for each cost item. The cost assumptions include factor assumptions text that describes the
sizing factors used in each equation (k, n). The factor assumptions text can be edited by the user if the
cost item needs to be updated to fit the user's Scenario. A sizing factor is used to relate the price of the
cost item to the structure and can represent density, length, quantity, or percentage. If the user changes
a sizing factor, then the factor assumptions text should be updated.
</p>
<p>
If the user adds a cost item that is not already default to a structure, then the user will need to specify
sizing factors to complete the cost equation. Otherwise, the tool will assume that the sizing factors have
a value of 1. The tool will automatically convert unit costs for those cost items added to a structure.
