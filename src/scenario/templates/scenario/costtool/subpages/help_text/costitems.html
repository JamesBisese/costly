    <ul style="margin-left: -25px;">
           <li>Unit Cost: User can choose to use costs listed in the tool from RSMeans and tool database costs
of the 25th, median, and 75th percentile. User can also input a different cost other than the
values provided by the tool. The user will need to specify from a dropdown list the cost
category:
               <ol type="a">
                    <li>Actual bid values from bid summary or awarded bid unit costs</li>
                    <li>Literature unit costs (i.e., RSMeans, research paper)</li>
                    <li>25th Percentile database unit costs</li>
                    <li>Median database unit costs</li>
                    <li>75th Percentile database unit costs</li>
               </ol>
           </li>
        <li>Year: User must define the year of costs if the user chooses to use a cost other than the
        RSMeans or database values provided in the tool. If the user does not define the year of costs,
                then the tool automatically assumes the cost to be from the base year (2018).</li>
        <li>Replacement Life: This is the amount of time (in years) that it would take before the user needs
        to fully replace the COST ITEM. Default values are provided by local engineers. The user can
                change the replacement life of the COST ITEM if necessary.</li>
        <li>Ongoing Operations and Maintenance Factor (%): This is the value that determines the annual
        operations and maintenance costs for each COST ITEM. This value determines the percent of
        total construction costs that each COST ITEM is expected to annually cost in operations and
        maintenance. Default values are provided by local engineers. The user can change the ongoing
                operations and maintenance factor of the COST ITEM if necessary.</li>
