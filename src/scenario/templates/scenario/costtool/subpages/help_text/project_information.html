    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Design Elements:</span>  This section summarizes the
        level of compliance that is met by the Project.
        Developers and designers need to consider stormwater management requirements
        for a Project site. There are three elements of stormwater compliance requirements
        that a developer must address:
        <ol>
            <li>Nutrient management</li>
            <li>Stormwater volume requirements</li>
            <li>Peak flow mitigation</li>
        </ol>

    <p><i>Level 1 - Nutrient Management</i></p>


    <p>According to the City of Raleigh's Unified Development Ordinance (UDO)
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 9.2.2.B.1. Nitrogen Reduction:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
    <span style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 2em;">
        C. Stormwater control measures shown on the stormwater control master plan for a new
        development or expansion of existing development that are demonstrated to control
        stormwater runoff on a runoff volume basis will be deemed to meet the nitrogen export load
        requirement, provided that the post-development volume of stormwater leaving the site is
        equal to or less than the pre-development volume, based on the 90th percentile storm. The pre-
        development land cover must be assumed to be forested for the entire site.
    </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        A developer that does not meet nutrient load requirements has the option to "buy down" a portion of
        their nutrient load from a DWR approved nutrient offset provider to meet loading rate targets . The buy
        down requirements are different across watersheds and should be considered for the Cost Analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Level 2 - Stormwater Volume Requirements</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the City of Raleigh's UDO <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 9.5.2.C. 3. & 9.5.3.C.3.a.:</span>

    </p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 2em;">
            [Note: Four criteria listed for exception approval] In requesting a design exception, the
            developer must demonstrate that runoff resulting from the first inch of rainfall over the entire
            development site will be detained or retained using conventional stormwater treatment
            practices, GSI, or a combination.
        </span>
    <p>
Stormwater practices that are designed to manage nutrient mitigation (see Level 1) must also be
designed to detain both the water quality one-inch storm and the one year, 24-hour three-inch storm.</p>
    <p>
        <i>Level 3 - Peak Flow Mitigation</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        According to the City of Raleigh's UDO
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 9.2.2.E Stormwater Runoff Controls: </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 2em;">
            The peak stormwater runoff leaving any site for the two-year and 10-year storms shall be no
            greater at every point of discharge for post-development conditions than pre-development
            conditions. The same methodologies used to calculate stormwater runoff must be used for both
            pre-development and post-development conditions...
        </span>
    </p>
<p>
Developers need to consider peak flow control on their sites, which can be established using
conventional (Gray Infrastructure) end-of-pipe designs and non-conventional distributed (Green Infrastructure) structures. Sites that do not meet
peak flow requirements will need to be reevaluated and undergo changes in design so that peak flow
requirements are met.
</p>
<p>
The user should also be aware about the opportunities of savings made available when certain
compliance requirements are met:
</p>
         <p>
<i>Green Raleigh Review</i>
</p>
<p>
The City has added a new program called the
<a href="https://www.raleighnc.gov/home/content/PlanDev/Articles/DevServ/GreenRaleighReview.html"
style="color: green;">
Green Raleigh Review</a>, which is supposed to incentivize
developers to include more GSI in their design. Participants in this program will get reimbursements for
two fees:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Sketch Plan Review Fee</li>
<li>Express Service Fee</li>
</ol>
<p>
This program requires participants to show that GSI practices are in their design plans and that the
design mitigates stormwater runoff volume to the pre-project 90th percentile storm event conditions.
This is verified using the Storm EZ Permitting Tool. If the project plans are approved, the participant is
eligible for review fee reimbursements.

<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pervious/Impervious: </span>This section summarizes the amount of land in the Scenario of the Project site
that is expected to be pervious (porous area where water can infiltrate) or impervious (non-porous area
where water cannot infiltrate). These values are important when comparing Scenarios within a Project
site because developers are subject to stormwater fees based on the amount of impervious surface the
Project site has. GSI can mitigate the amount of impervious surface is on site by replacing surfaces of
different landscape features like asphalt and rooftop with porous pavers or vegetation, respectively.
</p>
    <p>
The single-family rate consists of five tiers that are based on the amount of impervious surface (in
square feet) of a property:
</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
    <li>Tier One-400 to 1000 square feet = $2.00/month</li>
    <li>Tier Two-1,001 to 3,870 square feet = $5.00/month</li>
    <li>Tier Three-3,871 to 6,620 square feet = $8.50/month</li>
    <li>Tier Four-6,621 to 9,500 square feet = $14.50/month</li>
<li>Tier Five-Over 9,500 square feet is billed at the commercial rate = Total Impervious surfaces
divided by 2,260 (1 SFEU) times $5 = monthly fee</li>
</ul>
</p>
    <p>

The Commercial rate (e.g. multifamily, office, institutional, commercial industrial land uses;
including single family parcels over 9,500 square feet)
</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
    <li>$5 per 2,260 square feet of impervious surfaces</li>
<li>A commercial fee is calculated by the following formula. Total Impervious surfaces divided by
2,260 (1 SFEU) times $5 = monthly fee</li>
</ul>
</p>
    <p>
One Single-Family Equivalent Unit (SFEU) represents the median impervious surface area found on a
single-family property.
</p>
    <p>
Note: properties with less than 400 square feet of impervious surfaces are not subject to a Stormwater
        fee.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Area:</span> This section summarizes the Land Area in this Scenario for the Project site.
Land Area refers to developed land attributes within a Project site (e.g., building, parking area),
sometimes required by the City UDO (e.g., protective yard, amenity area), that have distinct boundaries
including stormwater management practices (e.g., wet pond, bioretention, wetland). The area for each
Land Area that is present in the Scenario should be added by the user. Land Area that do not
apply to a certain Project Type will be automatically crossed out in the tool.
</p><p>
If you would like to learn more information about the Land Area, click on the name of the Areal
Feature. The information will highlight the set of Structures that can be designed in each Land Area.
These Structures are either Gray Infrastructure end-of-pipe systems or Green Infrastructure distributed GSI
systems. This tool will also provide information about the new opportunities in Raleigh's UDO where
distributed GSI systems can be implemented in the Land Area (e.g., planter boxes in parking
islands). Potential benefits based on the design's ability to meet compliance standards will also be
presented on this page.

<p>
Areas used exclusively for treating stormwater, generally Structural Best Management Practices (BMPs) or Stormwater
Control Measures (SCMs), are designed to manage large volumes of stormwater for complying with regulations for reducing
stormwater peak flow rates, stormwater volume, and/or pollutant concentrations, depending on regulatory requirements and
performance objectives. Gray Infrastructure SCMs can require permanent dedication of large land areas (e.g., wet ponds, dry
ponds, stormwater wetlands) and usually are located along the downslope periphery of project sites. Green Infrastructure
stormwater management practices, when distributed within other site features, can reduce the land area needed for
treating stormwater and make more land area available for other uses and/or reduce the land area needed for the
development, possibly resulting in cost savings or added value for the development.

<p>
Many development sites are required by the City's UDO to have an amenity area or an urban
plaza. An amenity area is any feature that provides comfort, convenience, or pleasure. An urban plaza can be a public
square or an open area near urban buildings featuring walkways and places to sit that are surrounded by trees and
shrubs. The UDO prescribes size requirements for amenity areas and urban plazas based on the type of development and the
development site. Amenity areas and urban plazas usually contribute to the amount of impervious surface area on a
development site and thereby contribute to the site's stormwater treatment requirements. However, the City's UDO allows
placement of GSI practices within amenity areas and urban plazas, which can reduce the extent of stormwater treatment to
be provided elsewhere on the site. These sections of the UDO address placing GSI practices within amenity areas or urban
plazas: </p>
    <p>
    <strong>UDO Section 1.5.3.C.7.</strong> Stormwater detention wet ponds and dry ponds shall not be considered an outdoor amenity
area. GSI practices may be used to meet up to 10% of the requirement for the amenity area.
    </p>
    <p><strong>UDO Section 1.5.3.D.2.</strong> (For
Urban Plazas) In addition, vegetated GSI practices may be located within the amenity area and may be used to meet up to
10% of the requirement for the amenity area. Stormwater detention wet ponds and dry ponds shall not be considered an
outdoor amenity area.

Protective yards are landscaping features used to obstruct the view of a development site from an
adjacent property or to otherwise serve as a visual buffer between disparate land uses. The City's UDO allows placement
of GSI practices within protective yards, which can reduce the extent of stormwater treatment to be provided elsewhere
on the site. These sections of the UDO address placing GSI practices within protective yards:
</p><p><strong>UDO Section 7.2.4.A &
7.2.4.B</strong> GSI practices shall be allowed in Transitional Protective Yard Types A2, B1, and B2 and in Street Protective
Yard Types C1, C2, and C3. In order to accommodate GSI practices the number of shrubs may be reduced in the Protective
Yards by ten (10) percent.
</p><p><strong>UDO Section 7.2.7.C.4</strong> Additional Requirements for Trees in a Protective Yards a. In a
protective yard, 50% of required trees shall be locally-adaptive evergreen species, except where an approved GSI
practice is within a protective yard.
</p><p><strong>5.b.vi. Shrubs, Protective Yard</strong> To accommodate multi-functional GSI practices as
part of an approved stormwater management plan, the number of shrubs may be reduced in the Protective Yards by 10%,
non-evergreen species may be used in lieu of up to 35% of evergreen shrubs, and all shrubs may be 24 inches when
planted.

<p>Parking islands are features within parking lots that separate blocks of parking spaces and provide
areas for landscaping within parking lots of development sites. Gray Infrastructure designs for parking islands usually use
shrubs and trees for landscape plantings. However, the City's UDO allows placement of GSI practices within parking lot
islands, which can reduce the extent of stormwater treatment to be provided elsewhere on the site. These sections of the
UDO address placing GSI practices within parking lot islands: UDO Section 7.1.1.C. GSI practices may be located in
perimeter islands if part of an approved stormwater management plan for the site. The Shrub requirements may be met
within GSI practices. UDO Section 7.1.7.D. & Section 7.1.7.E GSI practices may be located in [interior, terminal, and
median islands] if part of an approved stormwater management plan for the site. Required shade trees may be placed
within the GSI practices. A maintenance plan must be approved for the GSI practices.

<p>
On many development sites buildings contribute a substantial portion of the site's total
impervious area and thereby a substantial portion of the site's requirement for stormwater
treatment. Designs for development buildings can provide for rooftop materials or other systems
for managing building rooftop runoff that can reduce the extent of stormwater treatment to be
provided elsewhere on the site. Green roofs also can reduce the impervious surface area of a site.
</p><p>
These sections of the UDO address green roofs and rainwater harvesting as applied to stormwater
management:</p><p>

<p>
A drive-thru facility is feature that designates space within the Project site for the provision or
dispersion of products and/or services from a business or automated machine. These features typically require a compact
evergreen hedge to screen the vehicles passing through this part of the site. However, updates to Raleigh's UDO allow
for GSI practices in this setting.
</p><p>
UDO Section 7.2.5.A.4 (Drive Thru Facilities) The following options may be used in
lieu of compact evergreen hedge (1) a combination of plants within GSI practices proposed to be part of an approved
management plan and evergreen plants outside such GSI practices that together, at the time of planting, provide
screening at least 36 inches above the level of the ground adjacent to the GSI practice, and reach a height of at least
48 inches above adjacent ground within 3 years of planting.
</p><p>
The updates allow GSI to be a standard component of
drive-thru facilities to help with onsite stormwater management. GSI that can occur in drive-thru facilities include:<ul

<p>
Miscellaneous landscaping and open space are features within a Project site that are included to provide
aesthetics to the site. This is additional land that is not part of the legally required space,
but is just open space in the Project site. These can have a variety of plants and species present,
and can be a place for recreation or leisure in the site. These spaces may be left in its natural
state and become managed open space, can include conventional structures like lawns, shrubs, and
tree plantings, or can be areas where GSI is incorporated to increase overall stormwater management and aesthetics to the property.

    <p>
Streets have several development requirements that can impact a site's overall stormwater runoff.
For this feature, developers need to consider vegetative requirements within required planting areas and size
requirements of the road width.
Changes in the UDO allows developers to consider the use of GSI in planting areas
while maintaining understory tree requirements to better mitigate stormwater.

Required understory trees may be offset by installing vegetated GSI practices, such as stormwater planter boxes. A
maintenance plan must be approved for the GSI practice.</li>
<li> All required street trees must meet the design and installation requirements of Sec.7.2.7.  If a GSI practice is part
of an approved stormwater management plan for the site, required street trees may be installed within the GSI practice.

The use of GSI in medians should consider road crown or slope.
    </p><p>GSI that may be seen on Medians include:</p>
<ul class="help_ul_3">
<li> Swales
<li> Permeable Pavement, and
<li> Planter Boxes
</ul>
    Potential for savings:
<ul class="help_ul_1">
<li> Reduction in stormwater utility fees via reduction in impervious surface area ($/ft2/year)
<li> Reduction in Green Raleigh Review fees ($)
<li> Reduction in land needed exclusively for stormwater management ($)
</ul>

    <p>
Parking lots vary in scale and materials and have parking spaces requirements that developers need to
consider when building on a new Project site. These requirements can be adjusted if the developer preserves trees on
site: </p>
    <p>UDO Section 7.1.4. E.  Tree Preservation 1. Minimum required parking may be reduced by one parking space for each
tree 12 inches in diameter or larger that is preserved within the parking lot or elsewhere on the development site
within 50 feet of the parking area. The preserved trees shall be specified on the recorded plat.
    </p>
        <p>The update allows the
developer to save on costs for parking space size requirements and have funds available to make GSI a standard
            component
            of this feature, which will help with onsite stormwater management.</p>

    <p>
        Driveways and Alleys vary in scale and materials and usually have a required minimum width to meet development standards.
        The City encourages developers and designers to consider the use of permeable pavers on these features to help with stormwater management.
