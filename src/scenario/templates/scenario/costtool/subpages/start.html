        <h3>Getting Started (boilerplate)</h3>
        <p class="intro">The Raleigh Cost Too is a tool for quickly comparing the
            performance, costs, and benefits of Green Infrastructure, or Low Impact Development (LID),
            to conventional stormwater practices. The GVC is designed to take you step-by-step through a
            process of determining the average precipitation at your site, choosing a stormwater runoff
            volume reduction goal, defining the impervious areas of your site under a conventional
            development scheme, and then choosing from a range of Green Infrastructure Best Management
            Practices (BMPs) to find the combination that meets the necessary runoff volume reduction
            goal in a cost-effective way. </p>

        <p>A few important points to keep in mind:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The National GVC is currently focused on runoff volume reduction. It does not produce
                any peak flow results. Volume reduction in this context implies infiltration,
                evapotranspiration and reuse, and does not include detention in ponds or vaults. All
                runoff volume captured in BMPs is assumed to be kept on site.
            </li>
            <li>The National GVC is meant for a single site or a campus of buildings contained on a
                single site. If you are interested in looking at the performance and cost/benefit
                analysis of Green Infrastructure BMPs applied on a neighborhood or watershed scale,
                consider using the original GVC and/or some of the other stormwater tools provided
                below.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>To get started, select a tab at the top to enter site information. Default values (that can
            always be changed by the user) are provided throughout the calculator, so you can begin on
            any step. However, we recommend starting on the Lot Information page and proceeding through
            each step. Below is a brief description of the information you can provide on each page:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a onclick="toggleDescription('gs1');this.blur();return false;"
                   href="/natgreenvalues#">Lot Information</a>
                <ul id="gs1" style="display:none;">
                    <li>Site location by zip code, which defines the average precipitation for your
                        site. The user can override the average precipitation values if desired, e.g. if
                        the user knows and wants to enter the amount of precipitation for the 2-year
                        24-hour design storm.
                    </li>
                    <li>Site size</li>
                    <li>Site Hydrologic Soil Group (A-D)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a onclick="toggleDescription('gs2');this.blur();return false;"
                   href="/natgreenvalues#">Predevelopment</a>
                <ul id="gs2" style="display:none;">
                    <li>Site predevelopment conditions, meaning either the state of the site before a
                        particular project is built, or the pre-human development condition of the site.
                        The user provides the percent area of the site covered by different possible
                        land uses, e.g. lawn, trees, impervious, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a onclick="toggleDescription('gs3');this.blur();return false;"
                   href="/natgreenvalues#">Runoff Reduction Goal</a>
                <ul id="gs3" style="display:none;">
                    <li>Runoff volume reduction goal. The user can choose from a list of regulations
                        requiring different quantities of precipitation and/or runoff to be infiltrated,
                        evapotranspirated, or reused on site.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a onclick="toggleDescription('gs4');this.blur();return false;"
                   href="/natgreenvalues#">Conventional
                Development</a>
                <ul id="gs4" style="display:none;">
                    <li>Conventional development site conditions, including roof size, parking lot area,
                        and street, sidewalk, and driveway area.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a onclick="toggleDescription('gs5');this.blur();return false;"
                   href="/natgreenvalues#">Green Improvements</a>
                <ul id="gs5" style="display:none;">
                    <li>Green Infrastructure BMP options. The user can select from a wide range of BMPs
                        to determine which combination will best meet runoff reduction goals and budget
                        considerations.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a onclick="toggleDescription('gs6');this.blur();return false;"
                   href="/natgreenvalues#">Advanced Options</a>
                <ul id="gs6" style="display:none;">
                    <li>Lifecycle. The user can choose to analyze the lifecycle cost and benefits of
                        green and conventional stormwater systems over 5 to 100 years.
                    </li>
                    <li>Discount rate. The user can set the amortization rate which affects how the
                        dollar value of maintenance and future replacement costs affects lifecycle
                        costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Curve numbers. The user can choose to use the default curve numbers provided in
                        the calculator for various soil groups or fill in their own curve number values.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Results</h4>

        <p>The results statement at the bottom of the page continuously updates to reflect site
            conditions and BMPs defined by the user. The user does NOT need to click on a “Calculate”
            button to see the affect of different choices. The results are presented in detail on
            separate tabs. They include progress toward the specified runoff volume reduction goal,
            changes in the total runoff volume annually and for the average storm event for the
            predevelopment, conventional, and green scenarios, changes in the land use between the
            conventional and green scenarios, and detail on the lifecycle cost/benefit analysis.</p>
